hello world, whirlwind is here
am a technocrat that loves computers,my passion for programing has been the driving force to my achievements in recent years,
my most prefered language is php and mysql but most recently switched to python because of a developed intrest in datascience and machine learning.
i just recently joined in the google code in contest as a student with an eye on contributing to open source in the guise of sugarlabs.
